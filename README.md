# Overview

##### Gorm

- introduction
  - "GORM" stands for "Go Object-Relational Mapping," and it's a popular library in the Go programming language (also known as Golang) for working with relational databases. GORM provides an easy and convenient way to interact with databases by abstracting away many of the low-level details of database access, allowing developers to work with Go structs instead of writing raw SQL queries.
- features
  - Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
    - GORM is an ORM library, which means it enables you to map Go structs to database tables and automatically handles the conversion between the two. This allows you to work with objects in your code and have them seamlessly persisted and retrieved from the database.
  - Database Abstraction
    - GORM supports multiple database backends, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others. You can write code that's largely database-agnostic, making it easier to switch between different databases if needed.
  - CRUD Operations
    - GORM provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database. These operations are abstracted through methods like Create, Find, Update, and Delete.
  - Associations and Relationships
    - GORM supports defining relationships between different entities in your application, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. It handles fetching associated data and managing foreign keys.
  - Query Building
    - GORM offers a query builder that allows you to construct complex database queries using method chaining and a fluent syntax, without writing raw SQL.
  - Transactions
    - GORM supports database transactions, allowing you to group multiple database operations into a single transaction that either succeeds entirely or fails entirely.
  - Validation
    - GORM provides validation features that let you define validation rules for your struct fields to ensure data integrity before it's saved to the database.
  - Hooks and Callbacks
    - You can define hooks and callbacks in GORM to perform specific actions before or after certain database operations, like saving or deleting records.
  - Migration Management
    - GORM includes tools for managing database schema migrations, which helps keep your database schema in sync with changes in your code.
  - Customization
    - While GORM offers a lot of convenience, it also provides ways to customize its behavior to handle specific cases or edge scenarios.
